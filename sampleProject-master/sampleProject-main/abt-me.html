    <h1>Favorite recent memory</h1>
    <p>Recently in my sophomore year of high school up until this point i had been using a crappy hp pavilion laptop and I saved up for an upgrade, so I decided to build my own pc, and it worked out very well and got me into the mechanics of computers and hardware, so I did a lot of research on different parts and I know a lot about it, it is probably one of my favorite things to do, I have built myself a computer and upgraded it and I have also built my brother his pc.</p>

    <p>These are pictures of my first pc build, the specs of the build are as follows:</p>
    <p>B450 Tomahawk max, Ryzen 5 3600, RTX 3060, 16gb corsair vengeance ram, 1000w PSU, and NZXT H510Flow case</p>

    <p>This laptop was my first computer, it was an HP pavilion laptop that had terrible specs and would take 30 minutes just to boot fully</p>

    <p>this is a picture of my current pc setup, I upgraded to an MSI B760 Pro motherboard, an Intel i5-13400f, and an RTX 4070 which costed me close to $700</p>
    <p>I also upgraded my peripherals from a 22 inch 1080p 144hz monitor to a 32in 1440p 165hz HDR main monitor with a 27in 1440p 180hz second monitor</p>
