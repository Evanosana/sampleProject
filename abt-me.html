    <h1>Favorite recent memory</h1>
    <p>Recently in my sophomore year of high school up until this point i had been using a crappy hp pavillion laptop and I saved up for an upgrade so i decided to build my own pc and it worked out very well and got me into the mechanics of computers and hardware so I did a lot of reasearch on different parts and I know alot about it, it is probably one of my favorite things to do, I have built myself a computer and upgraded it and I have also built my brother his pc.</p>
